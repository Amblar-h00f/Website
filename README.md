What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?

*(I've been struggling to wrap my head around the mentality it takes to think like a programmer. I look at the big picture and get overwhelmed. I had some direction from Constance which prompted me 
to look into this concept. I did some research into this and watched a youtube video on this concept.


Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?


What would you add to or change about your website if given more time?

*(Oh alot of things, mostly I need to change my personal enviroment. I'm not quite set up for success at the moment.

Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again.
